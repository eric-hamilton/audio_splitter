# Python Audio Splitter

Python Audio Splitter is a simple utility designed to extract individual audio clips from a single audio file.

## Setup and Usage

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the folder:

Optional: Setting up a virtual environment (venv) for a cleaner setup:
- Create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Program
You have two options to run the program:

1. Run the file directly:
```   
python audio_splitter.py 
```
3. Drag and drop an audio file onto the `audio_splitter.py` script.
Follow the on-screen instructions displayed in the terminal to proceed with the audio splitting process.

The individual audio clips will be saved in a folder named "output" in the same directory as the script.
